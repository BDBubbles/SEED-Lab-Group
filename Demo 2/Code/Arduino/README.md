# Arduino code

The code works as a state machine where the robot moves through 4 states, searching, reading, turning, and moving. The searching state is when the robot slowly rotates in a circle and waits for the pi to send it a message. When we get the message we move to the reading state. In the reading state we read in the angle and distance we are from the aruco marker, it then moves to the turning state. The turning and moving states function the same as they did in demo 1 where we pulled that code and simply put it into seperate case statement where it first tries to move to the desired angle. Then after it is at the desired angle it goes to the moving state. In this state it just moves forward the distance given to us by the pi. After this we are on top of the marker and can then move back to the searching state again to reset the process.
