# Demo 2

All levels of the repository have a readme.md file that describes the purpose and organization. The code is well documented and easy to find. A project board was utilized to manage tasks and assign responsibility.

Your team should be organizing your code and other files in a common repository on github. Create a Demo 2 folder with a readme.md file that describes what is contained there, with further folder divisions as necessary to make everything easy to find. You should include:
- Well organized record of all models created in Simulink.
- Well organized Arduino sketches with detailed comments.
- Well organized Python code with detailed comments.
(They donâ€™t necessarily have to be organized into folders by language - it could be by task if that makes more sense.)
Your github should also have a project board that describes what tasks were assigned and who was responsible.
