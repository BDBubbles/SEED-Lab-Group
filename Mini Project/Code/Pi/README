Aruco detection scheme explanation
For our Raspberry Pi Python code, we implemented an aruco detection scheme that identifies the markers via the OpenCV and Aruco marker detection libraries.
After detecting the markers, we calculate the center x and y pixel values of the marker, and determine which of the 4 quadrants the marker is in. From that point, we
send the Arduino the desired angle in radians.
